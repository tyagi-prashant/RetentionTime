# RetentionTime

Prediction of retention time of lipids using deep learning.
About the Project:

Molecular descriptors for all available lipids from database lipidmaps will be generated using open source tool OPENBABEL. All possible descriptors will be used to build a regression model that will have a optimized neural network framework that can map relations of structure-function predictions and enhance the prediction for problems with small and noisy training data.
